# Learning Path

Use one of these tracks based on your current level and timeline. Each week maps directly to files in this repository.

## Track A: Beginner Foundation (4 Weeks)

### Week 1: Python Learning System
- Read [`Mega_Prompt_Templates_Python_Learning.md`](Mega_Prompt_Templates_Python_Learning.md)
- Read [`Python_Learning_Mastery_Techniques.md`](Python_Learning_Mastery_Techniques.md)
- Outcome: You can self-study any Python topic using active recall and prompt templates.

### Week 2: DSA Basics
- Read [`complexity.md`](complexity.md)
- Practice from [`leetcode_easy.md`](leetcode_easy.md)
- Outcome: You can explain common complexity classes and solve easy pattern problems.

### Week 3: API and Backend Basics
- Read [`technical_fastapi.md`](technical_fastapi.md)
- Revisit relevant Q&A in [`interview_questions_visualized.md`](interview_questions_visualized.md)
- Outcome: You can explain API fundamentals and FastAPI behavior confidently.

### Week 4: Deployment and Cloud Basics
- Read [`docker.md`](docker.md)
- Read [`aws.md`](aws.md)
- Outcome: You can explain containerization and core AWS services in interviews.

## Track B: Intermediate Consolidation (4 Weeks)

### Week 1: Structured Revision
- Skim all one-liner sections in:
  - [`docker.md`](docker.md)
  - [`aws.md`](aws.md)
  - [`complexity.md`](complexity.md)
- Outcome: Fast recall baseline across DevOps/Cloud/DSA.

### Week 2: GenAI Core Depth
- Read [`gen_ai_developer_interview_questions.md`](gen_ai_developer_interview_questions.md)
- Extract weak areas into a personal list.
- Outcome: You can answer foundational and architecture-level GenAI questions.

### Week 3: Cross-Topic Interview Practice
- Practice from [`interview_questions_visualized.md`](interview_questions_visualized.md)
- Do timed responses (60-90 seconds per one-liner answer).
- Outcome: Better verbal clarity and response speed.

### Week 4: Project-to-Interview Translation
- Use templates in [`Mega_Prompt_Templates_Python_Learning.md`](Mega_Prompt_Templates_Python_Learning.md) to generate project narratives.
- Outcome: You can connect practical experience to interview answers.

## Track C: Interview Sprint (2 Weeks)

### Week 1: High-Yield Coverage
- Day 1-2: [`gen_ai_developer_interview_questions.md`](gen_ai_developer_interview_questions.md)
- Day 3: [`technical_fastapi.md`](technical_fastapi.md)
- Day 4: [`docker.md`](docker.md)
- Day 5: [`aws.md`](aws.md)
- Day 6-7: [`interview_questions_visualized.md`](interview_questions_visualized.md)
- Outcome: Broad interview readiness in one week.

### Week 2: Rapid Mock + Gap Closure
- Daily: 1 mock round from mixed files.
- Daily: 1 weak-area patch session from source docs.
- Final day: full mock (GenAI + Python + System/API + DevOps + DSA).
- Outcome: End-to-end interview confidence with identified weak spots reduced.

## Recommended Default
If you are unsure, start with Track A, then do Track C before interviews.
