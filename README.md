# Gen AI + Python Interview Learning Repository

[![Docs Quality](https://github.com/nihalgbailur/Gen_AI_100_questions/actions/workflows/docs-quality.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nihalgbailur/Gen_AI_100_questions/actions/workflows/docs-quality.yml)

This repository is a structured learning collection for public learners preparing for Python, GenAI, cloud, DevOps, API, and DSA interviews.

## Who This Is For
- Learners preparing for technical interviews with a practical, notes-first approach.
- Developers who want quick revision sheets plus deeper conceptual references.

## 30-Second Quick Start
1. Open [`learning/LEARNING_PATH.md`](learning/LEARNING_PATH.md) and choose a track.
2. Use [`learning/STUDY_PLAN_30_DAYS.md`](learning/STUDY_PLAN_30_DAYS.md) for day-wise execution.
3. Start with the first core topic below and follow each file's `Next doc` link.

## Quality Gates
Every PR/push is checked by CI with:
- `markdown-lint`
- `link-check`
- `topic-structure-check`
