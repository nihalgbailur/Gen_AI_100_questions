# FAQ

## How should I start if I am overwhelmed?
Start with [`LEARNING_PATH.md`](LEARNING_PATH.md), choose Track A, and follow the order in [`README.md`](README.md).

## Do I need to read every file fully?
No. Use one-liner sections first, then deep-dive only into weak topics.

## How do I use this repo for interview prep?
1. Read one topic file.
2. Practice saying one-liner answers out loud.
3. Expand with elaboration only when prompted.
4. Repeat with mock checkpoints from [`STUDY_PLAN_30_DAYS.md`](STUDY_PLAN_30_DAYS.md).

## How often should I revise?
- Daily: quick one-liner review.
- Weekly: one mock interview checkpoint.
- Monthly: refresh time-sensitive docs (`GenAI`, `Cloud`, `DevOps`).

## Which files matter most for GenAI interviews?
Start with:
- [`gen_ai_developer_interview_questions.md`](gen_ai_developer_interview_questions.md)
- [`interview_questions_visualized.md`](interview_questions_visualized.md)
- [`technical_fastapi.md`](technical_fastapi.md) for API/system discussion support.

## How do I verify if a claim is still current?
Follow [`SOURCES_AND_UPDATES.md`](SOURCES_AND_UPDATES.md). If a numeric/datetime claim has no citation or old verification date, update it before relying on it.
